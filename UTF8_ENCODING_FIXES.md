# UTF-8 Encoding Fixes Summary

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Email templates showing "Thanks â€" we received" instead of "Thanks - we received"
- **Cause**: UTF-8 encoding issues with em dash characters (—) and HTML entities (&rsquo;)

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Email Template Character Fixes**

1. **Replaced Em Dash Characters (—) with Hyphens (-)**:
   - `booking_confirmation.html`: "Thanks — we received" → "Thanks - we received"
   - `consultation_confirmation.html`: "Thanks — we received" → "Thanks - we received"
   - `contact_confirmation.html`: "Thanks — we received" → "Thanks - we received"
   - `project_confirmation.html`: "Thanks — we received" → "Thanks - we received"
   - `admin_booking.html`: "Booking #{{id}} — {{service}}" → "Booking #{{id}} - {{service}}"

2. **Fixed Title Tags**:
   - `booking_confirmation.html`: "Booking confirmed — GoodAV" → "Booking confirmed - GoodAV"
   - `consultation_confirmation.html`: "Consultation received — GoodAV" → "Consultation received - GoodAV"
   - `project_confirmation.html`: "Project Confirmation — GoodAV" → "Project Confirmation - GoodAV"
   - `admin_project.html`: "New Project Notification — GoodAV" → "New Project Notification - GoodAV"

3. **Fixed Time Range Characters**:
   - All templates: "1–2 business days" → "1-2 business days"

4. **Fixed HTML Entities**:
   - `consultation_confirmation.html`: "&rsquo;" → "'" (simple apostrophe)

### ✅ **PHP UTF-8 Configuration**

Added `$mailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';` to all PHPMailer instances:

1. **process_booking.php**:
   - Admin mailer: `$adminMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`
   - Client mailer: `$clientMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`

2. **process_contact.php**:
   - Admin mailer: `$adminMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`
   - Client mailer: `$clientMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`

3. **process_project.php**:
   - Admin mailer: `$adminMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`
   - Client mailer: `$clientMailer->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`

## Testing Results

### ✅ **All Forms Tested with Gmail Address**

```bash
# Consultation Booking
